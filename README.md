Script that returns a list of people who you are following, but are not following you back on instagram.

Unable to get unofficial API's such as Instaloader working as Meta does not like you playing around with said unofficial API's.
Also a pain doing it via webscraping as the tags, elements and xpath are always changing.

Meta's offical instagram graph API does not provide access to the followers and following lists, only the count.

This method requires downloading your information, so it is less convenient, but gets the job done.
